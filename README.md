History of Acting is a site that hopes to educate people interested in acting - teachers and students. The site informs about the lesser known theatre practitioners. Most actors are familiar with the teachings of Brook and Stanislavski. This site educates about the thoughts of Meyerhold, Grotowski and Brecht on the craft. There is an option on the website to book Dublin based classes relating to each of the practitioners. There are also links to useful YouTube videos on the site.

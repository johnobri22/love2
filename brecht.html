        <p>Meyerhold’s mission was to separate art from life. At the time he came to fruition, Serge Diaghilev,
            Bakst and Benois, were flooding those interested with oriental, foreign and exotic images to create a
            gap between art and reality. Stanislavki was using alien sets. Picasso presented a composite image of
            the face made up of its features seen simultaneously from three angles. Sculptures began to be created
            out of tubes, metal, wire instead of stone. Writers broke away from logical sequence and linear
            expression and experimented with sounds, hoping somehow to release long-forgotten meanings that lay in
            the roots of words, and to use sound as a means of creating an impression or an emotion. A new artistic
            vocabulary emerged. Tretyakov proclaimed “Repulsive is the virgin forest, unused waterfalls . . . rain
            or snow, avalanches, caves and mountains. Beautiful is everything that bears the trace of man's
            organising hand.“ Formalism began (emphasis on structure over content). Bryusov attacked naturalism
            saying



            Audiences cannot really believe that what they are seeing is real.

            Reality cannot be reproduced. If it could it would not be art.

            Art (Theatre) is convention. Artists must master specific conventions

            Actor is like sculptor before mound of clay



            Adolphe Appia: “only non-representational sets could give actors the expressive freedom they needed to
            convey the meaning of the play”



            It was even suggested that actors be replaced by puppets



            Theatre was no longer actors interpreting a given piece of writing



            The audience became part of the production No longer ignored, or apparently so, by the actors on stage.
            Plays constructed audience reaction instead of interpreting/deconstructing text. DEFAMILIARISATION -
            make the familiar unfamiliar. Unpleasant for actors. Directors including meyerhold became like
            dictators. Like conductors who expect their musicians to know their job. In 1922 meyerhold produced
            Biomechanics in direct contrast to Stanislavsky’s naturalism. He rejected Aristotlinian ecstasy/purge
            and like Diderot OPPOSED SENSIBILITY. Like early version of Hitchcock. What he wanted was a quick,
            automatic response to external stimuli– excitability in the strict sense of the word.

            Ecstasy is the notorious inner experience, the 'authentic emotion'; it is the system of my teacher
            Stanislavski . . . we need not ecstasy but excitation, based firmly on the physical premise.*

            (Meyerhold on Theatre, p. 200)



            Biomechanics is related to the notion that the production of a performance is the same as the production
            of consumer goods. FREDERICK TAYLOR. Meyerhold wanted actors who could respond immediately and
            efficiently to direction, whose reflexes were razor-sharp. He pointed to the economy and effectiveness
            of skilled workers, who used no superfluous effort. Worker on a production line is like a dancer.
